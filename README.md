An example configuration of these environment variables is in the `.env.example` file.

## Run the application with `Docker`

Create your environment typing :

```sh
cp .env.example .env
```

Then from current project directory run :

```sh
docker-compose up
```

## Run the application with `springboot-plugin`

Create your environment:

```sh
export $(grep -v '^#' .env.local | xargs)
```

Then from current project directory run :

```sh
mvn spring-boot:run
```

Note that with this method you would also need an active Redis instance on your local machine.
We suggest you to use the [ecommerce-local](https://github.com/pagopa/pagopa-ecommerce-local) instead.

## Code formatting

Code formatting checks are automatically performed during build phase.
If the code is not well formatted an error is raised blocking the maven build.

Helpful commands:

```sh
mvn spotless:check # --> used to perform format checks
mvn spotless:apply # --> used to format all misformatted files
```

## CI

Repo has Github workflow and actions that trigger Azure devops deploy pipeline once a PR is merged on main branch.

In order to properly set version bump parameters for call Azure devops deploy pipelines will be check for the following
tags presence during PR analysis:

## Dead lettering

This microservice has a built-in logic that write events to dead letter queue.
This dead letter queue is used to store all events that cannot be processed by this microservice.
There are common scenario for which an event can be written to dead letter queue:

1. syntactically incorrect input event
2. unhandled exception raised during event processing
3. retry attempt exhaustion for a refund retry event or refund process interruption (because of blocking error codes as
HTTP 400 for which a retry has no meaning)
4. retry attempt exhaustion for sending user notification (mail)

### Monitoring

Since an event can be written to dead letter queue for multiple reasons (see above) there is a mechanism that,
contextually to dead letter event writing to dead letter queue
create an OpenTelemetry span that is used to display an overall dead letter queue event dashboard.
This span has the following fields:

| field key                            | description                                                                                                                            | mandatory |
